Q. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

A. The Gaming Room client is creating a web-based game where player's choose images that are rendered at a steady rate from a large libary of stock drawings for other players to guess a puzzle. The client had asked for help making a decision on which platform the application should be developed on. Characterisitcs, advantages, and disadvantages of each platform were evaluated, which lead to the decision that Windows should be the platform of choice. 

Q. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

A. Labeling the strengths and weaknessed of each platform is what I think I did well on in developing this documentation, and the recommendation I chose was justified with many examples on why the conclusion was made.

Q. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

A. The design dovumentation was well made, and helped to keep my document organized and concise. Using a design document helped me to label important information such as requirements and design constraints, which I would keep them open on the side as I worked on developing the code to ensure all requirements were met.

Q. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

A. I would choose to revise my evaluation, as I included a lot of information that could have been clearer and more concise. I would have cut the information by at least a quarter to prevent repeated information and information that was not as relevant to the problem at hand. 

Q. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

A. I interpreted the user's needs into the software design by thinking about what platform would make the user experience the best when coming up with a recommendation for the platform to be developed on. For instance, not all user's will have the same specifications, so making sure everyone has an equaly playing field is important to keep the game balanced and enjoyable. This would include RAM differences, which could speed up or slow down the game for certain users. It is important to consider the user,s needs when designing because The user experience should be as flawless as possible to keep user retention at a maximum, as without user's, there would be no use for an application, especially a game where user's need to be engaging for the game to survive.

Q. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

A. I approached designing software as first typing all of the requirement's of the fotware, and then coming up with design contraints, and pulling it up on another screen to reference as I designed the software. This helps to make sure all requirements of the client are met, and any design contraints are thought about and adressed.
